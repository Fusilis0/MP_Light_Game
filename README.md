This is a multiplayer puzzle solving escape room game which uses color mechanics and color theory.
For now have mirror mechnanic which allow players to direct colored lines as thehir wish.
Also have color blend mechanic. Light source has 3 buttons which works as RGB buttons. Players can switch color of light and blend 2 or 3 colors to create new colors.
Only includes 2 basic levels. But I might add new levels and new mechanics in the future.
